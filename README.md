### Hey! I'm Karl!

I'm currently a Data & Applied Scientist at Microsoft.

I am passionate about taking on difficult business problems and translating them into actionable insights using all sorts of data science methods: from simple but informative visualizations to fancy deep learning models -- whatever gets the job done by delivering the maximum business value possible. I care for the full stack of solving a data science problem: I love communicating with stakeholders to figure out what needs to be solved and communicating any results to them as much as I love coding up the solution itself.

The pinned repositories on my profile reflect my mindset quite well, but the coolest and most impactful stuff I've worked on has been done during my professional work experience, which I sadly cannot share here. If you'd like to hear more about what I've done, get in touch!
